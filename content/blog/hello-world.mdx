# Welcome to My Blog

Most blogs are filled with the same recycled content. "Build a Todo App." "10 AI Tools You Need to Try." You've seen it all before.

I'm not here to add to that pile.

## What This Is

I'm a developer fascinated by what's actually possible when you combine AI with automation. The tools exist. The APIs are accessible. But most content either hypes technology without substance or teaches toy examples that don't scale.

This blog is my exploration of what's real.

When I build something interesting (scraping systems, AI tools, automated workflows, whatever), I'll break it down here. The code. The approach. What worked and what didn't.

No schedule. No forced content. Just real projects when they're worth sharing.

## What You'll See

I'm not committing to specific topics or a rigid format, but here's the kind of stuff I'm interested in:

- **AI applications** that solve actual problems, not demos
- **Automation systems** that eliminate real work
- **Emerging tools** like n8n, new AI APIs, and workflow platforms, tested honestly
- **Experiments** with trading systems, lead generation, data extraction, whatever catches my attention

Some projects will work. Some will fail. I'll share both.

## Why This Exists

I'm building this stuff anyway. Might as well document it.

If you're interested in the practical side of AI and automation (not the hype), this might be for you. I'm not promising to teach you anything. But if you're curious about what you can actually build with these tools, follow along.

Let's see where this goes.
